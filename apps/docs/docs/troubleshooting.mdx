# Troubleshooting your BashBuddy installation

## "SHELL environment variable is not set" error

BashBuddy requires the SHELL environment variable to be set with the path to your shell executable. This may not be set on Windows.

If you encounter this error:

1. For Windows users:
   - Open PowerShell
   - For Windows PowerShell, run: `setx SHELL "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"`
   - For PowerShell Core, run: `setx SHELL "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"` (adjust path as needed)
   - Restart your terminal

The official installer script should set this automatically for Windows users.
