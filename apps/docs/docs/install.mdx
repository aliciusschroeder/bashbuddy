# Installing BashBuddy

Installing BashBuddy is easy! You just need to run the following command:

<Tabs groupId="install-method">
  <TabItem value="bash" label="MacOS & Linux">
    ```bash curl -fsSL https://get.bashbuddy.run/install.sh | bash ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows">
    ```powershell powershell -c "irm https://get.bashbuddy.run/install.ps1 |
    iex" ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun">
    ```bash bun install -g @bashbuddy/cli ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Verifying Installation

To verify that BashBuddy is installed correctly, run:

```bash
bashbuddy --version
```

You should see the current version number displayed.

## Next steps

Once you have BashBuddy installed, you'll need to choose between using it locally, or using [BashBuddy Cloud](/cloud).

### Using locally

> If you computer is not fast enough to run the AI model locally, you won't have a great experience.

Setup the local model by running:

```bash
bashbuddy local
```

You will be prompted to choose a model. The CLI will download and install the model for you.

Once the model is installed, you can start using BashBuddy by running:

```bash
bashbuddy ask echo 5 times 4
```

### Using BashBuddy Cloud

Refer to the [BashBuddy Cloud](/cloud) page for more information.

## Installing the alias

Typing `bashbuddy ask` in your terminal all the time is slow. We expect you to be more productive than that!

To make it easier to use, you can install the alias by running:

```bash
bashbuddy alias
```

If installed correctly, you should be able to use `bb` instead of `bashbuddy ask`.

```bash
bb git commit add new feature with no verify
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting).
