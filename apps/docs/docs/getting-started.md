# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

BashBuddy is an AI-powered terminal assistant that helps you write commands with natural language.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Head over to the [install page](/install) and follow the instructions to install the CLI.
2. If your system is not fast enough to run the AI model locally, try using [BashBuddy Cloud](/cloud)! (it's just $2, and completely private)
3. Start being more productive with BashBuddy!
